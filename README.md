# precalc-calculator (unit circle)

This is a simple interactive unit circle calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

You can:

- Enter any angle (in degrees) from 0° to 360°
- Calculates and displays:
  - Cosine (x-coordinate)
  - Sine (y-coordinate)
- Shows the point on the unit circle using SVG graphics
- Includes projections for sine and cosine
- Lists special properties of sine and cosine functions

I used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- SVG for visualizing the unit circle

Enjoy learning the unit circle!

Thanks!
